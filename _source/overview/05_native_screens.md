# Native Screens

There are times where neither web-based content nor [native components](/overview/native-components) are enough. Times where you need maximum fidelity or interaction with native SDKs and APIs. For these, you can build fully native screens in Kotlin and Swift.

Dropping down to native should be used sparingly for only the most important or impactful features of your app. Building out a native screen requires significantly more effort than building a screen for the web. Not only will each screen need to be written for every platform, but you will need to go through app store review for any future changes.

The good news is that once you "break out" of Hotwire Native you are building a regular ol' iOS or Android app. Which means you can follow any tutorial on how to do what you want - it doesn't have to be specific to Hotwire Native.

Check out the [iOS](/ios/native-screens)- and [Android](/android/native-screens)-specific pages for information and code snippets.
